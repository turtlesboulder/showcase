make stats a list?


Add mobile support; Drag controls for the map and move the side panel to the top


Add hp, mp, and block bars

make it so that damage message doesn't pause the game and is only visible during the attack animation

there are a lot of timers. Mabey move them to a separate class and return a boolean on that's step function?
