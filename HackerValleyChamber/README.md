# Hacker Valley Chamber

This project was a school assignment. It is a chamber of commerce website for a place that does exist, although all the content is fictional. That's why there are some funny looking pictures and such, because I drew them all. This site isn't at all associated with Hacker Valley, nor am I from there, I just thought the name sounded funny. 

There are a few funny things in the website, like the date in the header, but they were part of the school assignment. There is javascript in most of the pages, and the site gets weather data from OpenWeather. 

I think this website looks fairly good. There's a form and the whole thing is responsive with a hamburger menu. I would love to improve it with animations in the future.
