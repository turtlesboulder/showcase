# Roads

The program is actually named MetropolitanDistributizer, because I like funny program names. It creates random roads that flow in random directions. This is to create a basic plan for a 'naturally grown' city. 

It does some things that I don't like, like roads that are much too close to one another, but it basially fulfills what I learned about how people grow cities; They start with one big road and then branch out from that in semi-random patterns, sometimes intersecting in odd ways and forming odd shapes.
