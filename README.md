# showcase
I am Landon Lee, this respository is meant to show some of the things that I am capable of. I am a student at BYU-Idaho, and love to code. My favorite and what I have the most experience with is Javascript, as if something is a web app, it is much more accessable than with other tools. I also have experience in Python, Java, R, PHP, Kotlin, and C++.

It is divided into several smaller folders with their own README files. It would be good to read those.
