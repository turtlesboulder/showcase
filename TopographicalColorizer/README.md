# Topographical Colorizer

This tool was created for me, and if I inputted a file that contained some shapes with the correct colors, it would create "topographical features" like mountains or plateaus. The output looks very colorful. 

Green areas are "low elevation" orange/red/purple is "medium elevation" and blue is "high elevation".

This program was only ever meant to be used once, on the input file that is provided in this folder. The output is also provided, and was suitable for my needs. I think it looks cool!

This was written a long time ago, so there are several silly things like me using magic numbers for colors and not using a switch/break. Regardless, the program got the job done with a few bugs that I liked enough that they became features.
